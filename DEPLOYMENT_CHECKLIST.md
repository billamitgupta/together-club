- **Payment Issues**: Check Razorpay keys and webhook configuration
- **Function Timeouts**: Optimize database queries and API calls

### Frontend Issues
- **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version and dependencies
- **API Connection**: Verify REACT_APP_API_URL points to correct backend
- **Payment Integration**: Ensure Razorpay script loads and keys are correct
- **SEO Issues**: Verify meta tags are being set correctly

### Performance Issues
- **Slow Loading**: Optimize images, enable compression, use CDN
